# nosql-challenge

This project showcases the ability to import, modify, query, and analyze data using a noSQL database such as MongoDB. The data pertains to the UK Food Standards Agency API and focuses on many different aspects of establishments found across the country including names, locations, hygiene scores, and much more. Part 1 of this project mainly focuses on the importing and database creation for our data.

In part 2, the focus shifts to inserting a new document to our database. Moreover, other documents were updated, deleted, or had their field data types converted to more useful forms. 

Finally, in part 3, our newly modified data is ready to be analyzed. Through the use of articulate querying and pipeline aggregation functions, five analytical questions about our data could be answered.

1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
2. Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
3. What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
